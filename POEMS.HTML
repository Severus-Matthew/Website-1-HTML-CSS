         <h4> If You Can<br>
<hr>
If you can keep your head when all about you <br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you.<br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:<br>
If you can dream  - and not make dreams your master;<br>
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
And treat these two impostors just the same;<br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:<br>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'<br>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,<br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!<br>

	The Road Not Taken<br>
           Robert Frost<br>
<hr>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveller, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth.<br>
<br>
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same.<br>
<br>
And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
<br>
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--<br>
I took the one less travelled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.<br>

	It Couldn't be Done<br>
         Edgar Guest<br>
<hr>
<br>

Somebody said that it couldn't be done,<br>
But, he with a chuckle replied<br>
That "maybe it couldn't" but he would be one<br>
Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried.<br>
<br>
So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin<br>
On his face. If he worried he hid it.<br>
He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br>
That couldn't be done, as he did it.<br>
<br>
Somebody scoffed: "Oh, you'll never do that;<br>
At least no one we know has done it";<br>
But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,<br>
And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.<br>
<br>
With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,<br>
Without any doubting or quiddit,<br>
He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br>
That couldn't be done, and he did it.<br>
<br>
There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,<br>
There are thousands to prophesy failure;<br>
There are thousands to point out to you, one by one,<br>
The dangers that wait to assail you.<br>
<br>
But just buckle right in with a bit of a grin,<br>
Just take off your coat and go to it;<br>
Just start to sing as you tackle the thing<br>
That cannot be done, and you'll do it<br>

	   A Smile<br>
        Author Unknown<br>


<hr>
<br>
A smile costs nothing, but gives much-<br>
It takes but a moment, but the memory of it usually lasts forever.<br> 
None are so rich that can get along without it-<br>
And none are so poor but that can be made rich by it.<br>
<br>
It enriches those who receive, without making poor those who give-<br>
It creates sunshine in the home, <br>
Fosters good will in business, <br>
And is the best antidote for trouble-<br>
And yet it cannot be begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is of no value<br>
Unless it is given away. <br>
<br>
Some people are too busy to give you a smile-<br>
Give them one of yours-<br>
For the good Lord knows that no one needs a smile so badly<br>
As he or she who has no more smiles left to give. <br>

                            If You Think<br>

<hr>
<br>
If you think you are beaten, you are<br>
If you think you dare not, you don't,<br>
If you like to win, but you think you can't<br>
It is almost certain you won't.<br>
<br>
If you think you'll lose, you're lost<br>
For out of the world we find,<br>
Success begins with a fellow's will<br>
It's all in the state of mind.<br>
<br>
If you think you are outclassed, you are<br>
You've got to think high to rise,<br>
You've got to be sure of yourself before<br>
You can ever win a prize.<br>
<br>
Life's battles don't always go<br>
To the stronger or faster man,<br>
But soon or late the man who wins<br>
Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN! <br>

        REALITY OF SOCIETY<br>
<HR>
<br>
Sometimes I feel sad to be born<br> 
In a place like this <br>
Where emotions between everyone are torn<br>
Promises are made to be broken<br>
Where girls are born to be abused<br>
To be looked down and die<br>
Where boys are born to have <br>
All the liberty and fun<br>
Sometimes I feel sad to be born<br>
In a place like this<br>
Where discrimination is a major quality<br>
Against cast, creed, color and gender<br>
Where everyone is loyal to corruption<br>
And brotherhood is looked upon as a servant<br>
Where god is worshiped for money<br>
And promises are made for greed<br>
Where money is sacred<br>
And kindness is useless<br>
Where crimes and culprits rise up and innocence is punished<br> 
Where democracy is nothing less than dictatorship<br>
Where votes are casted for money<br>
Where rights are without duties<br>
Where doctors treat patients for money<br>
And medicines are without cure<br>
 Where people become saints for greed<br>
And temples are built for income<br>
Where mother earth cries  <br>
Because corruption is high<br>
And it will still rise<br>
Sometimes I feel sad to be born<br>
In a place like this <br>
Where emotions between everyone is torn<br>
And promises are made to be broken<br>
