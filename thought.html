<h1><b><i>THOUGHTS</h1></b></i>
<hr><b><i>
<br>
!	If someone talks ill about you be happy about it because birds peck on the best fruits<br>
<br>
!	Happiness presents itself before a man, wearing a crown of sorrow on its head.<br>
<br>
!	It is easy to hate but healthy to love <br>
<br>
!	There is no medicine like hope, no incentive so great, and no tonic so powerful as <br>
        expectation of something tomorrow.<br>
<br> 
!	What is beautiful is not always good but what is good is always beautiful. <br>
<br>
!	A little learning is a dangerous thing <br>
<br>
!	The bad workman never gets a good tool<br>
<br> 

!	A barking dog is often more useful than a sleeping lion <br>
<br>
!	A book, like a landscape, is a state of consciousness varying with readers <br>
<br>
!	A child is not a vase to be filled but a fire to be lit <br>
<br>
!	As heat conserved is transmitted into energy, so anger controlled can be transmitted<br>
 <br>         into power that can move the world <br>

!	Native ability without education is like a tree without fruit <br>
<br>
!	Arise, awake and stop not till goal is reached <br>
<br>
!	At times it is better to keep your mouth shut and let people wonder if you are a fool than <br>
        to open it and remove all their doubts<br> 
<br>
!	Discussion is an exchange of knowledge; argument an exchange of ignorance <br>
<br>
!	Seek not to understand that you may believe, but believe that you may understand <br>
<br>
!	A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on. Ideas have endurance without death.<br>
<br> 

!	Action speaks louder than words <br>
<br>
!	True friendship is a plant of slow growth and must undergo many hardships before it is  entitled <br>
         to the appellation<br>
 <br>
!	A little more persistence, a little more effort and what a failure may turn out into a glorious <br>                     
          Success<br>
<br>
!       Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened<br>
<br>
!	Those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind<br>
<br>
!	Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe<br>
<br>
!	Be yourself; everyone else is already taken<br>
<br>
!	Be the change that you wish to see in the world<br>
<br>
!	You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough<br>
<br>
!	In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on<br>
<br>.
!	Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: "What! You too? I thought<br>
         I was the only one<br>
<br>
!	A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you<br>
<br>
!	Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much<br>
<br>
!	Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.”<br>
<br>
!	I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, <br>
          things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually <br>
       learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together<br>
<br>
!	Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: <br>
        only love can do that<br>
<br>
!	I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did,<br>
         but people will never forget how you made them feel<br>
